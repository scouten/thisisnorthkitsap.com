**Hi, I'm Eric.**

This my home for my travel photography.

As of this writing (September 2021), I'm just getting started with this blog. I plan to move some previous content from other sites and will be writing new articles soon.

I am also [a software developer](https://ericscouten.dev) and [an explorer of my home state](https://146parks.blog).

I hope you enjoy following this or another of my blogs!
