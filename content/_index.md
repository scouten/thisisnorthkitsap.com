**Hi, I'm Eric.**

I moved to Kitsap County, Washington, in the summer of 2004. I started this photoblog in the summer of 2009 as a way to get to know more of the people and places that surround me, and also to grow as a photographer. The photos on this blog are taken within 20 miles of my home.

## Where Is North Kitsap?

Some of you, I imagine, are reading from places far away. In case you're not sure what North Kitsap means, hopefully this helps:

_(TO DO: insert nk map, or maybe pull code from 146p for showing where the photos are)_

We are located in western Washington, only a few miles north and west of downtown Seattle. Since there are no bridges across Puget Sound, we rely on ferries -- or the occasional drive through Tacoma -- for transportation to the mainland. This helps keep North Kitsap relatively quiet and rural in nature despite its apparent proximity to the big city.

_(Some might question the inclusion of Bainbridge Island as part of North Kitsap, but I live only a few miles from B.I., so I consider it part of my community nonetheless.)_

## Under Re-Construction

As of this writing (September 2021), I'm quietly restarting this blog. I'm reviving content from the earlier version of this site and will be sharing new photos I've taken since that earlier version soon.

I am also [a software developer](https://ericscouten.dev) and [an explorer of my home state](https://146parks.blog).

I hope you enjoy following this or another of my blogs!
