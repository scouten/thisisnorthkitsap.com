## About This Site

This site is built using the [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation) static site generator.

Zola uses the [Tera](https://tera.netlify.app) templating framework.

The theme that I've built uses the [Bulma](https://bulma.io/documentation/customize/with-sass-cli/) SCSS framework.

Everything else is pretty much of my own construction.
